# machine_learning-challenge

3 machine learning models were created to see which model gave the greatest accuracy of the data available.
    -Logistic Regression Model: Accuracy of .8842
    -Random Forest Model: Accuracy of 0.8898
    -Deep Learning Model: Accuracy of .9079
    
The most accurate and most successful model was the Deep Learning model.  Therefore, it is reasonable to say that although all of the models would do a good job predicting exoplanet candidacy, the deep learning model would provide superior results compared to the logistic regression and random forest models.  All models are good enouggh to predict new exoplanets.  It is possible that using a SVM model, KNN model or even adding layers to the deep learning model could create a more accurate model.
